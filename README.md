    Bonus points
    
    Add a login page, registration page, forget password Instead creating users by the admin.
          
           I make a simple home page with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and django-allauth to implement this.
           On the header page on top right, you will see an login? or logout text that you can click to login or logout
      
          Access URL = http://localhost:8000/
